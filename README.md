## About

At its core, the Core Engine Gateway functions as the cornerstone of our application's architecture, enabling efficient communication among the myriad microservices within our landscape. It excels as the primary facilitator for data and command exchange, underpinning seamless service integration and cooperation.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Gateway Operations**: Serves as the primary conduit for all incoming queries, routing them to the correct microservice for action.
- **Data Management**: Adapts and standardizes data to ensure uniformity and compatibility across our ecosystem.
- **Security Protocols**: Implements stringent security measures for authentication, authorization, and data integrity.
- **Error Management**: Employs comprehensive error-handling, retry mechanisms, and failover strategies to bolster system reliability.
- **System Monitoring**: Integrates advanced monitoring and logging functionalities for enhanced operational insight and troubleshooting.

### Core Principles

- **Modularity**: Employs a compartmentalized architecture for easier scalability, maintenance, and future growth.
- **Performance**: Optimizes for speed and efficiency, utilizing asynchronous operations and caching to improve service delivery.
- **Resilience**: Prioritizes system reliability, incorporating robust design patterns and redundancy to counteract failures.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures seamless third-party service integration by adhering to established standards and protocols.
- **Innovation**: Dedicates to perpetual refinement and advancement, evolving continuously to meet changing needs and leverage new technologies.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you get a local instance of the Core Engine Gateway up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have these essential tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Execution environment
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - Application framework
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Container platform

### Installation

Refer to the [Installation](#installation) section to prepare your development environment.

## Post-Installation Steps

Follow these steps to configure and kickstart your application post-installation:

### 1. Environment Setup

#### a. Create a `.env` file at the project's root to house environment-specific variables.
#### b. Populate this file with necessary values from `.env.example`.
#### c. Update placeholders in `.env` with your real configuration data, such as database URLs and API keys.

### 2. Database Initialization

A MongoDB instance is crucial for the application. Set this up locally or connect to a cloud instance:

- **Local MongoDB**: Verify its operation on your machine, pointing your `.env` `DATABASE_URL` to it.
- **Cloud MongoDB**: Update your `.env` `DATABASE_URL` with the provided remote connection string.

### 3. Docker Integration

Using Docker Compose streamlines running the application, especially when managing microservices:

##### 1. Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` outlines all dependent services.
##### 2. Boot up the services with `docker-compose up` in your terminal.

## Usage

Interacting with the Core Engine Gateway involves:

- **Sending Requests**: Direct your HTTP requests to `http://localhost:${PORT}` for routing to the appropriate service.
- **Exploring APIs**: Access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:${PORT}/api` for detailed API documentation and testing.

## Configuration

System setup revolves around environment variables for ease of configuration. Key points include database settings, authentication parameters, and logging specifics. The `.env.example` file lists all necessary variables.

## Deployment

Deploying the Core Engine Gateway can be achieved through:

- **Docker**: Create a Docker image and launch your service.
- **Kubernetes**: Use Kubernetes for scalable container management.
- **CI/CD**: Automate deployment with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed! Please follow these steps to contribute:

##### 1. Fork the project.
##### 2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
##### 3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
##### 4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
##### 5. Open a pull request.
